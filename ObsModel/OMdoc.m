%  Observation Model directory.
%
%  Sub-directory with the implementation of the different observation 
%  models. 
%  An observation model is a probability defined on the state and 
%  observation spaces 
%    OM: S x O -> [0,1]
%  describing the probablity of getting a particular observation when in a
%  given state.
%  
%  The implementations in this directory contemplate the case of S and O to
%  be discrete of continuous spaces.
