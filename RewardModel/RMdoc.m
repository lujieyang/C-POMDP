%  Reward Model directory.
%
%  Sub-directory with the implementation of the different reward models. 
%  A reward model is a function defined on the state and action 
%  spaces 
%    AM: S x A -> Reals
%  describing the reward received when executing a given action from a
%  given state.
% 
%  The implementations in this directory contemplate the case of S and A to
%  be discrete of continuous spaces.
