%  Action Model directory.
%
%  Sub-directory with the implementation of the different action models. 
%  An action model is a probability defined on the state and action 
%  spaces 
%    AM: S x A x S -> [0,1]
%  describing the probability of moving from one state to another when a
%  given action is executed.
% 
%  The implementations in this directory contemplate the case of S and A to
%  be discrete of continuous spaces.
